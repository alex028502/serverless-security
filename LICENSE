Given that I have dependencies with all kinds of licenses that I haven't looked
at, and that I have copied a few lines of code directly that have an MIT
license whatever that means, if I am still in a position to legally reserve any
rights over anything, then these are the conditions under which I am licensing
anything that I am in a position to reserve:

If you are like a billionaire, or a tech giant, or the future equivalent or
successor of either, or you are destined to become one of those things or become
part of one of those things...

And if there is any "IP" in here that as explained above I am in a legal
position to "own", then before or after you use the "IP", the minimum price is
a thousand bucks for every day I put into this project (adjusted for inflation).
I also reserve the right to rescind that right and demand a higher price later
for continued use if I legally able to reserve that right.

Since I don't have a lawyer, and I've never read a license, I don't know which
rights I am legally able to reserve.  However, if you are in one of the above
categories, you probably do, so just fill out a github issue if you figure you
owe me something.

If you are not a billionaire or a tech giant, and are not destined to become one
or become part of one, then feel free to copy any "valueble IP" in this project
and feel free to not give me any credit at all, except if you are passing it on
to one of the small groups who are not allowed to use my "IP" for free, in
which case, I guess you have to tell them the conditions.

To be clear, if you don't even have a lawyer to tell you what all this means,
then you are pretty safe to:
- copy anything you want from this project as long as you don't blame me if any
of the ideas are "bad ideas"
- not give me any credit at all unless not giving me credit risks giving some
billionaire or tech giant (or future equivalent) (or anybody destined to
become one, or become part of one) the mistaken idea that this is completely
free software... unless one day you do fall into one of the above categories, in
which case we will assume that one of the things that helped you get there was
my "IP", but then you won't mind paying up anyhow.
